# 📈 S&P 500 per M2 Ratio — Tableau Visualization

An analytical visualization built in **Tableau** that compares the **S&P 500 Index** to the **U.S. M2 Money Supply** over time.  
This ratio explores how stock market valuations evolve relative to total liquidity in the system.

---

## 🎯 Overview

The **S&P 500** represents the 500 largest U.S. companies and serves as a proxy for the overall stock market.  
**M2** reflects the total money supply — cash, deposits, and near-liquid assets — representing both *actual* and *potential* purchasing power.

This chart answers the question:  
> “How expensive are stocks relative to the total pool of money currently in the system?”

## 💡 Key Insights

- Each time the **S&P 500/M2** ratio approaches **0.21**, major market downturns tend to occur.  
- The ratio only climbed *significantly above* that level once before — during the **2000 DotCom Bubble** — and it now appears to be **approaching that extreme again** amid the current **AI-driven market**. 
- The current **AI-driven market** appears to be revisiting historically elevated territory near **0.32**.  

This visualization suggests that **liquidity cycles** play as big a role as **innovation** in driving markets:  
> “Markets don’t move because of innovation alone — they move because of money flow.  
> And whenever valuations outrun liquidity, they eventually come back to earth.”
